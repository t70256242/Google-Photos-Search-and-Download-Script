- Selenium
- PyAutoGUI
- ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome browser version)
- Google Chrome browser

---

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium pyautogui requests
   ```

3. **Download ChromeDriver**:

   ```bash
   python google_photo_search.py
   ```

2. **Enter Player's Name**:
   - When prompted, enter the name of the player whose photos you want to search and download.

3. **View Downloaded Images**:
   - The downloaded images will be saved in the same directory as the script with filenames like `{player}_download_{count}.jpg`.

---

## Configuration

### Chrome Options
The script uses the following Chrome options for browser configuration:
- `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`: Disables automation detection.
- `--start-maximized`: Starts the browser in maximized mode.
- `--window-size=1280,800`: Sets the browser window size.
- `--disable-gpu`: Disables GPU acceleration (useful for headless mode).

### Headers
The script uses custom headers to mimic a real browser request:
```python
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
    "Referer": "https://www.google.com/",
}
```

### Random Delays
The script uses random delays to mimic human behavior:
```python
time_series = [6, 8, 9]  # Random delays in seconds
time.sleep(random.choice(time_series))
```

---

## Error Handling

The script handles the following exceptions:
- `NoSuchElementException`: Element not found.
- `TimeoutException`: Timeout while waiting for an element.
- `StaleElementReferenceException`: Element reference is stale.
- `ElementNotInteractableException`: Element is not interactable.
- `WebDriverException`: General WebDriver error.
- `requests.RequestException`: Error during image download.

If an error occurs, the script will retry the operation up to 3 times before quitting.

---

## Limitations

- **Anti-Bot Mechanisms**: Some websites may detect and block automated scripts.
- **Headless Mode**: Certain websites may not work properly in headless mode.
- **Image Source**: The script assumes the image source is either a URL or a base64-encoded string.
